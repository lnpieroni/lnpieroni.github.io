    <h1>Len's Personal Web Page</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome! You're probably expecting this page to be informative or entertaining. It's not; it's just empty. Maybe that will change someday. In the meantime, I have some info about me <a href="aboutMe.html">here</a> if you're interested. I'll be posting about any projects I finish and maybe a little bit about cool stuff I do.
