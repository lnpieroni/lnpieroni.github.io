    <h1> Len's Personal Web Page </h1>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome! You're probably here because of <a>this survey</a>. If that's the case, I won't keep you. <a>Click here</a> to access the bios of the freshmen of 2 North.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other than the bios and Google Form linked above, there's currently nothing to see here. I'll probably add more stuff eventually, but don't hold your breath. My time is mostly spent with friends, clubs, or classes so this site is an afterthought. For more about what I do with my time, check out my "About Me" page when I get around to making one. It'll happen someday.</p>
